# Red Button Page

## Project Overview
This web application is a simple, yet efficient, tool for demonstrating the power of Bootstrap CSS and basic JavaScript. The project was developed with the singular goal of rendering a red button on a webpage, with the text "Click Me" on the button. When the button is clicked, an alert pops up notifying the user that they clicked the button. 

The primary purpose of this application is to illustrate how to create a responsive design using Bootstrap, as well as how to add basic functionality to an HTML element using JavaScript. This application can serve as a foundation for developers who are looking to understand the basics of web development, and can be extended to include more complex interfaces and functionality.

## Requirements
The application was developed to meet the following requirements:
- The page must have a red button.
- The text on the button must be 'Click Me'.
The above requirements were met by using Bootstrap's button class to create the button and CSS to set the button color to red. The button text was set directly in the HTML.

## Installation & Setup
To install and setup this application, follow the steps below:
1. Ensure that you have a modern web browser installed (such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge).
2. Download the provided `index.html` file.
3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the file and double-click it. The file will open in your default web browser.
4. Alternatively, you can open the file from your web browser by clicking `File > Open` and selecting the `index.html` file.

## Usage Instructions
Once you have opened the `index.html` file in your web browser, you will see a red button in the center of the page with the text 'Click Me'. To use the application, simply click the button. Upon clicking, an alert will pop up with the message 'You clicked the red button'. 

## Technical Details
This application is a single-page application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface is constructed using HTML and Bootstrap CSS. The button's red color was achieved by writing custom CSS. The 'Click Me' button's functionality is powered by JavaScript. 

When a user clicks the button, a JavaScript event listener triggers an alert to pop up. This event listener is added to the button using JavaScript's `addEventListener` method and listens for 'click' events.

## Troubleshooting
If you are unable to see the button or if the button does not respond to clicks, ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your web browser. Most modern web browsers come with JavaScript enabled by default, but it can be disabled. If JavaScript is disabled, the button click functionality will not work. 

If the button does not appear red, check to see if your web browser is overriding the page's CSS. Some browsers have settings or extensions that can override a page's styles.
